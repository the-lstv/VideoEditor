# VideoEditor
A full featured video editor built with LS

## A full modern rewrite of this project is underway!
It will be much more robust, fully modular and customizable, with hardware acceleration, and hopefully much more!

This old version sadly cannot be easily run anymore since it relied on an extremely old version of both LS and Akeno that used very poor design practices. It would take a lot of work to get the conditions just right to run it. Luckily, the new version is much more robust and maintainable, so it won't happen again :)
